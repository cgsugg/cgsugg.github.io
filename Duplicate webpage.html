    <h1><b> Beach’s Summer Virus Plan: 197 Groups in Zones 18-Feet <br>Square</b></h1>

<p>POINT PLEASANT BEACH, N.J. — One lifeguard will sit perched on a tall wooden chair. 
    Two others, <br>maintaining distance, will stand sentinel on the beach below.</p>
<p>All three will wear scarflike masks and carry face shields and respirators equipped with new <br>HEPA filters.</p>
<p>They will patrol a beach that a town engineer determined can hold precisely 197 groups in zones <br>roughly 18-feet square, allowing six feet of space in between.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to make sure that we can safely open as much as possible, as quickly as possible,” <br>said Paul M. Kanitra, the mayor of Point Pleasant Beach, N.J., about 70 miles south of New <br>York City. “And that we don’t misstep too early.”</p>
